In our previous video, we have discussed the k-means algorithm.
Here is an example of k-means in R.

We will be using the iris data set for this example.
```{r}
data(iris)
head(iris)
str(iris)
```

Now, we remove the Species column from the iris dataset.
```{r}
iris_new <- iris[-5]
```

Let's use k-means clustering. We should indicate the number of clusters. Since Species has 3 levels, let's have 3 clusters.
```{r}
iris_kmeans<- kmeans(iris_new, 3) 
iris_kmeans
```

Since we already know the levels of Species, we can check our clustering result and see how many mistakes we have made. Here is the table:
```{r}
table(iris$Species,iris_kmeans$cluster)
```
